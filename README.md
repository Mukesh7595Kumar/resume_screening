# 🧠 AI-Powered Resume Screening Assistant

An intelligent resume screening tool that ranks resumes against a given job description and generates recruiter-friendly summaries using **Google Gemini AI**. This project is designed to streamline the hiring process, save time for recruiters, and improve the quality of candidate selection.

## 🚀 Features
- **Text Extraction:** Automatically extracts text from resumes in various formats (PDF, DOCX).
- **Vector-Based Matching:** Uses **Hugging Face embeddings** and **FAISS** to perform semantic matching between resumes and job descriptions, going beyond simple keyword searches.
- **AI-Powered Summaries:** Leverages **Google Gemini AI** to generate concise, insightful summaries of top candidates, highlighting their strengths and relevance to the role.
- **Interactive UI:** A user-friendly **Streamlit** interface allows for easy uploading of job descriptions and resumes, and clear visualization of the results.
- **Exportable Results:** Saves the ranked list of candidates, their similarity scores, and AI summaries to a **CSV file** for easy integration with other HR systems.

## 📊 Business Value
In a competitive job market, finding the right talent quickly is crucial. This tool provides significant business value by:
- **Reducing Time-to-Hire:** Drastically cuts down the manual effort required to screen hundreds of resumes, allowing recruiters to focus on engaging with top-tier candidates. We estimate a time saving of **~5 minutes per resume**, which translates to over **8 hours saved for every 100 resumes**.
- **Improving Candidate Quality:** The semantic search capability ensures that candidates are matched based on the context and meaning of their skills and experience, not just keywords. This leads to a higher quality of shortlisted candidates.
- **Enhancing Recruiter Efficiency:** By providing AI-generated summaries, the tool helps recruiters quickly grasp a candidate's qualifications without needing to read through the entire resume, making the decision-making process faster and more effective.

## 🏗 Project Structure
The project follows a clean and modular architecture:
```

├── data/
│   ├── resumes/
│   │   ├── resume1.txt
│   │   └── resume2.txt
│   └── job_description.txt
├── .env                # For storing API keys
├── app.py              # Main Streamlit application
├── embeddings.py       # Handles text extraction and vector store creation
├── ranker.py           # Ranks resumes based on similarity
├── summarizer.py       # Generates AI summaries
├── requirements.txt    # Project dependencies
└── README.md           # This file
```

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Streamlit:** For the web interface.
- **LangChain:** As the core framework for orchestrating the AI components.
- **FAISS:** For efficient similarity search in the vector store.
- **Hugging Face Transformers:** For generating high-quality text embeddings.
- **Google Gemini AI:** For generating candidate summaries.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and CSV export.
- **PyMuPDF & python-docx:** For parsing PDF and DOCX files.

## ▶️ How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd resume_screening
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Your API Key
- Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
- Open the `.env` file and replace `"your_api_key_here"` with your actual **Google API Key**.
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key"
```

### 5. Run the Streamlit App
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
The application will open in your web browser.

## 📈 Sample Output
The application will display a ranked list of candidates. For each candidate, you will see:
- **Rank and File Name**
- **Similarity Score:** A score indicating how well the resume matches the job description.
- **AI Summary:** A bullet-point summary generated by Gemini AI.

You can also download the full results as a CSV file.

| Rank | File              | Similarity Score | AI Summary                                                                                                                            |
